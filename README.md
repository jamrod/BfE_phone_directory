# BfE test Project

## Instructions
In this task, you are asked to create a simple online phone directory application to allow users to list and search through a list of phone contacts

#### Track 1: Full Stack ( React + Django )
You need to create a single page application which allows users to
1. View all contacts in the directory
2. Search through the contacts
3. Add new contacts to the directory
* The web application should be built in React.
* The application should make appropriate REST API calls to the django backend to
perform the corresponding actions.
* The flow, UI, UX and styling of the application is left up to you. Although there are no
marks for these, an easy to use application is always preferred.
